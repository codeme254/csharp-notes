# Access Modifiers
Access modifiers control who can access what in your code.

They are essential for:
- Enforcing encapsulation
- Reducing accidental misuse
- Making your code clean, safe and reusable.

C# has the following access modifiers:
- `public`: anyone anywhere can access.
- `protected`: inside the class and any subclasses.
- `private`: only within the class itself.
